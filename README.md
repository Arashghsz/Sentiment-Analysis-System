# Sentiment-Analysis-System
This project involves fine-tuning a sentiment analysis model on the IMDB dataset, saving and uploading the model to Hugging Face, and testing it alongside the pre-trained Llama 3 model via the Groq Cloud API. The project also includes designing systems, testing models, and submitting a GitHub repository and a YouTube video link.
